HD 117176 = 70 Vir is Star c in HKGRP207b.30 from the T4 APT.  Analysis shows 
it to be a low-amplitude variable with an amplitude of a few mmag. Star b may 
also be a low amplitude variable.  To analyze HD 117176, we create 
differential magnitudes c-ab.by.  From the whole data set we get 
P = 183.89 +/- 0.10.  From seasons 6, 7, & 8 we get P = 173.22 +/- 0.93.  
From seasons 9, 10, & 11 we get P = 184.30 +/- 1/05 days.
